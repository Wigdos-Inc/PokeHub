"dEntry": "A strange seed was planted on its back at birth. The plant sprouts and grows with this POKéMON.",
"dEntry": "There is a plant bulb on its back. When it absorbs nutrients, the bulb is said to blossom into a large flower.",
"dEntry": "Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.",
"dEntry": "From the time it is born, a flame burns at the tip of its tail. Its life would end if the flame were to go out.",
"dEntry": "When it swings its burning tail, it elevates the air temperature to unbearably high levels.",
"dEntry": "Its wings can carry this POKéMON close to an altitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out fire at very high temperatures.",
"dEntry": "After birth, its back swells and hardens into a shell. It powerfully sprays foam from its mouth.",
"dEntry": "This POKéMON is very popular as a pet. Its fur-covered tail is a symbol of its longevity.",
"dEntry": "It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause fainting. In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.",
"dEntry": "It is covered with a green skin. When it grows, it sheds the skin, covers itself with silk, and becomes a cocoon.",
"dEntry": "Even though it is encased in a sturdy shell, the body inside is tender. It can’t withstand a harsh attack.",
"dEntry": "In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to release highly toxic dust into the air.",
"dEntry": "Often found in forests, eating leaves. It has a sharp stinger on its head that injects poison.",
"dEntry": "This POKéMON is in a temporary stage while making its body. It is almost completely unable to move on its own.",
"dEntry": "May appear in a swarm. Flies at violent speeds, all the while stabbing with the toxic stinger on its rear.",
"dEntry": "A common sight in forests and woods. It flaps its wings at ground level to kick up blinding sand.",
"dEntry": "The claws on its feet are well developed. It can carry prey such as an EXEGGCUTE to its nest over 60 miles away.",
"dEntry": "It spreads its gorgeous wings widely to intimidate enemies. It races through the skies at Mach-2 speed.",
"dEntry": "Its fangs are long and very sharp. They grow continuously, so it gnaws on hard things to whittle them down.",
"dEntry": "It uses its whiskers to maintain its balance. It apparently slows down if they are cut off.",
"dEntry": "It busily flits around here and there. Even if it is frail, it can be a tough foe that uses MIRROR MOVE.",
"dEntry": "Its huge and magnificent wings can keep it aloft in the sky. It can remain flying a whole day without landing.",
"dEntry": "A very common sight in grassland, etc. It flicks its tongue in and out to sense danger in its surroundings.",
"dEntry": "The pattern on its belly appears to be a frightening face. Weak foes will flee just at the sight of the pattern.",
"dEntry": "It has small electric sacs on both its cheeks. If threatened, it looses electric charges from the sacs.",
"dEntry": "Its electric charges can reach even 100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause even an Indian elephant to faint.",
"dEntry": "It burrows and lives underground. If threatened, it curls itself up into a ball for protection.",
"dEntry": "It is adept at attacking with the spines on its back and its sharp claws while quickly scurrying about.",
"dEntry": "Although small, its venomous barbs render this POKéMON dangerous. The female has smaller horns.",
"dEntry": "The female has a gentle temperament. It emits ultrasonic cries that have the power to befuddle foes.",
"dEntry": "The body is covered by stiff, needle-like scales. If it becomes excited, the needles bristle outwards.",
"dEntry": "Its large ears are flapped like wings when it is listening to distant sounds. It extends toxic barbs when angered.",
"dEntry": "It is easily angered. By swinging its well-developed horn wildly, it can even punch through diamond.",
"dEntry": "It is recognized by its rock-hard hide and its extended horn. Be careful with the horn as it contains venom.",
"dEntry": "With its magical and cute appeal, it has many admirers. It is rare and found only in certain areas.",
"dEntry": "A timid POKéMON that is rarely seen, it will run and hide the moment it senses people.",
"dEntry": "While young, it has six gorgeous tails. When it grows, several new tails are sprouted.",
"dEntry": "Very smart and very vengeful. Grabbing one of its many tails could result in a 1,000-year curse.",
"dEntry": "It captivates foes with its huge, round eyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing a soothing melody.",
"dEntry": "The body is soft and rubbery. When angered, it will suck in air and inflate itself to an enormous size.",
"dEntry": "It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on its ultrasonic cries for echo location to flit about in darkness.",
"dEntry": "Once it bites, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly.",
"dEntry": "During the day, it keeps its face buried in the ground. At night, it wanders around sowing its seeds.",
"dEntry": "Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor. The horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance of 1.25 miles.",
"dEntry": "Its petals are the largest in the world. It fiendishly scatters allergy-causing pollen from its petals.",
"dEntry": "Burrows to suck tree roots. The mushrooms on its back grow by drawing nutrients from the bug host.",
"dEntry": "A host-parasite pair in which the parasite mushroom has taken over the host bug. Prefers damp places.",
"dEntry": "Its eyes act as radar, enabling it to be active in darkness. The eyes can also shoot powerful beams.",
"dEntry": "The wings are covered with dustlike scales. Every time it flaps its wings, it looses highly toxic dust.",
